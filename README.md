# Playing Games With Machine Learning
My dissertation, including projects I wrote implementing machine learning concepts such as Q-Learning and Neural Networks. Cumulates in developing a bot capable of learning to play Tic-Tac-Toe.

Developed when I was still really getting into c#, but I am still quite proud of what I achieved.
